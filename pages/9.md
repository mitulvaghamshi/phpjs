# Regular Expressions

- Regular expressions are a powerful tool for validating and sanitizing user
  input that go far beyond what can be done with HTML form attributes and the
  PHP `filter_input` function
- Regular Expressions (RegEx or RegExp for short) are a string matching
  technique supported by HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and most other computer
  languages
- This lesson focuses on how regular expressions are constructed, then future
  sections focus on how to use them in PHP, JavaScript, and HTML code

## Basic Syntax

- In most implementations, a regular expression must start and end with a
  delimiter character
- Most implementations use the forward slash (`/`) character as the delimiter
- The simplest regular expression is just a sequence of characters between
  delimiters
- It matches any string that contains that exact sequence of characters
  somewhere within it

```
/rain/
matches: "rain", "train", "it’s raining", "fdjal fdsarainl45 jakl"
does not match: "hello", "Rain", "12312", "I HATE RAIN!!!"
```

- If you put an i character after the second delimiter, it makes the matching
  case insensitive
- Characters placed after the second delimiter are referred to as modifiers

```
/rain/i
matches: "rain", "train", "Rain", "I HATE RAIN!!!"
```

## Wild Cards

- The following special codes are wild cards that can be matched by several
  different characters

| Expression | Match                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `.`        | Matches any character                 |
| `\w`       | Matches any alphanumeric character    |
| `\W`       | Matches any non-aphanumeric character |
| `\s`       | Matches any whitespace character      |
| `\S`       | Matches any non-whitespace character  |
| `\d`       | Matches any digit character           |
| `\D`       | Matches any non-digit character       |

```
/...\w\d\D/
matches: any string containing "abc77?", "!@#Z0x"
does not match: "abc" or "abc%gg"
```

## Character Ranges

- You can use square brackets (`[...]`) to specify a set of characters, and you
  can also use the hyphen (`–`) to specify a range of characters
- If you use the caret (`^`) symbol just inside the brackets (i.e. `[^...]`), it
  will match any character that is not in the specified range

| Expression | Match                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `[adh]`    | Matches a, d, or h                      |
| `[a-g]`    | Match a, b, c, d, e, f, or g            |
| `[67za-g]` | Matches 6, 7, z, a, b, c, d, e, f, or g |
| `[^abc]`   | Matches any character except a, b, or c |

- Each range expression above matches exactly one character

```
/[abc][A-D][^a-z]/
matches: any string containing "aAA", "bD$", "cC4"
does not match: "Aaa", "bDd", "cc4",
```

- The backslash can also be used to escape special characters like `[` and `]`
  and `–`

```
/a\[b/
matches: any string containing "a[b"

/[a\-c]/
matches: any string containing "a" or "b" or "-"

/a[b/
regular expression syntax error
```

## Anchoring Expressions

- The caret (`^`) matches the start of the string (unless it’s inside square
  brackets – see above), and the dollar sign (`$`) matches the end of a string
- You can use them to anchor your pattern to the start or end of the string
  you’re matching

```
/^abc/
matches: "abc", "abcd", "abc 123", "abcdefg"
does not match: "aabc", "123 abc", "1abc2"

/abc$/
matches: "abc", "aabc", "123 abc", "defgabc"
does not match: "abcc", “abc 123", "aabcd"

/^abc$/
matches: "abc"
does not match: everything else
```

## Repetition

- You can specify that an expression can be repeated by appending special codes
  to it

| Expression | Match                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `?`        | zero or one occurrence   |
| `*`        | zero or more occurrences |
| `+`        | one or more occurrences  |
| `{m}`      | m occurrences            |
| `{m,n}`    | from m to n occurrences  |
| `{m,}`     | m or more occurrences    |

```
/labell?ed/
matches: any string that contains the word "labelled" or "labeled"

/label+ed/
matches: any string containing "labeled", "labelled", "labellled"

/[abc]{5}/
matches: "aaaaa", "abcab", "bcbca", or any other string containing a sequence of exactly 5 a’s, b’s and c’s in any order
```

## Grouping

- You can use round brackets `()` to apply a repeatition operator to an entire
  expression

```
/(john)*doe/
matches: any string containing "doe", "johndoe", "johnjohndoe"

/^([sS]am )?[sS]cott$/
matches: "john doe", "john doe", “john doe", "john doe", "doe", and "doe"
```

- You can also place a pipe character (|) in a group as a logical or operator

```
/^(Rosa |[mM]ax )St-Amand$/
matches: "Rosa St-Amand", "Max St-Amand", "max St-Amand", and "St-Amand"
```

- Finally, you can repeat a matched group once the match has been made using
  `\#` where `#` is the index of the bracketed group
- The first bracketed group has index `1`

```
/^(rosa|max) st-amand \1$/
matches: "rosa st-amand rosa" or "max st-amand max"
does not match: "rosa st-amand max" or "max st-amand rosa"
```

## Server-Side Regular Expressions

- The `preg_match` function in PHP can be used to find out whether a regular
  expression matches a given string
- This function returns 1 if there’s a match, 0 if there is no match, and false
  if there’s an error (for example a syntax error in the regular expression
  string)
- The regular expression must be defined within a single-quoted string

```php
$pattern = '/^[A-Z][0-9][A-Z] ?[0-9][A-Z][0-9]$/';

$string = filter_input(
    INPUT_POST,
    "postalcode",
    FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS
);

if (preg_match($pattern, $string)) {
    // it’s a legal postal code!
} else {
    // it’s not
}
```

- You can also include a third argument that must be a variable name such as
  `$matches`
- After the call to the `preg_match` function, this variable will contain an
  array with one element in it
- This element will contain the matching substring found by `preg_match`

```php
preg_match('/[A-Z]+/', "RegEx RULES!", $matches);
var_dump($matches);

// Output:
array(1) { [0] => string(1) "R" }
```

- If you want to obtain all the matching substrings in the `$matches` array, use
  the `preg_match_all` function instead
- Then `$matches` will contain an array with one element, but this element will
  itself be an array containing all matches

```php
preg_match_all('/[A-Z]+/', "RegEx RULES!", $matches);
var_dump($matches);

// Output:
array(1) {
    [0] => array(3) {
        [0] => string(1) "R",
        [1] => string(1) "E",
        [2] => string(5) "RULES"
    }
}
```

## Client-Side Regular Expressions

- On the client side, both JavaScript and HTML have support for regular
  expressions

## The JavaScript RegExp Object

- In JavaScript, a regular expression is a special kind of object of type
  `RegExp`
- You can create a `RegExp` object using a constructor function, with a regular
  expression string and a modifier string specified separately with no
  delimiters, as shown below

| Regular Expression | RegExp object                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/[abc]{5}/i`      | `let abc = new RegExp("[abc]{5}", "i");` |
| `/label+ed/`       | `let lbl = new RegExp("label+ed");`      |

- JavaScript also contains special support for RegExp object literals that
  allows you to type regular expressions directly into a program without quotes
- The above two regular expression objects could have been created in this way
  as well:

```js
let abc = /[abc]{5}/i;
let abc = /label+ed/;
```

- To find out if a regular expression matches a string, you can use the RegExp
  test method
- This method takes a string argument and returns true or false depending on
  whether it matches the regular expression

```js
let abc = /[abc]{5}/i;
let str = "abcde";

if (abc.test(str)) {
  // matches!
} else {
  // doesn't match
}
```

- To identify the substrings that match a regular expression, you can use the
  string match method
- This method takes a RegExp argument and returns an array of matches it finds
  or null if it finds none
- If you want to find all the matches, and not just the first one, you must use
  the global modifier g when creating the RegExp object
- Otherwise, the match method will return an array containing just the first
  match along with the index where it was found
- The `g` modifier is not supported in PHP regular expressions

## Example (Single Match)

```js
let str = "RegEx RULES!";
let match = str.match(/[A-Z]+/); // First match only
if (match !== null) {
  console.log(match[0]);
  console.log("Index " + match.index); // Index of match
}

// Output:
// R Index 0
```

## Example (Multiple Matches)

```js
// Special g modifier, all matches returned
let str = "RegEx RULES!";
let matches = str.match(/[A-Z]+/g);

if (matches !== null) {
  for (let i = 0; i < matches.length; i++) {
    console.log(matches[i]);
  }
}

// Output:
// R
// E
// RULES
```

## The HTML pattern Attribute

- Many HTML `<input>` elements can be given a pattern attribute
- This attribute takes a regular expression as its value, then checks user input
  against it before allowing the form to be submitted
- The pattern attribute supports most regular expression syntax with the
  following minor differences:
  - No delimiters or modifiers
  - The whole string must match the pattern (as if `^` and `$` were always used)
- Here is an example adapted from
  [W3S Input Pattern](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_input_pattern.asp)

```html
<input required type="text" placeholder="USA"
    pattern="[A-Za-z]{3}" title="Three letter country code" />
```

- The form that contains this `<input>` element cannot be submitted until the
  user fills in exactly 3 alphabetical characters
- The required attribute prevents submission with an empty input element, and
  the title and placeholder attributes give the user hints about the correct
  format
