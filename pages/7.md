# Ajax

- When you start typing into the Google search box, you immediately get
  suggestions from the Google database about what to search for
- When you view a social media feed, it starts you with a small list of items,
  and as you scroll down, it loads more and more items for an endless news feed
- Both of these are examples of Ajax in action
- Before Ajax, if you wanted to get some more content for the user, you had to
  load and display a new page
- With Ajax, you can launch an HTTP Request from JavaScript, receive the HTTP
  Response without a page load, and incorporate it into the page through DOM
  manipulation
- Ajax originally stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
- It’s a data transfer format that looks a bit like HTML
- These days, most apps use JSON for data transfer instead of XML, but the name
  Ajax has stuck anyhow.

## Your First Ajax Request

- The helloAjax example in the sample code on Canvas gives the user a single
  button
- When it’s pressed, the contents of the file hello.txt are loaded from the
  server and displayed on the page
- Load the page in Chrome, open the Network tab in the Developer Tools and press
  the button on the page, you will see the Ajax HTTP Request appear, and you can
  view it along with the

## HTTP Response

- If you change the contents of hello.txt and press the button again, the text
  on the page should change as well

## 1. An Aside: Fetch vs XMLHttpRequest

- There are two APIs for Ajax
- The older `XMLHttpRequest` API is supported on all browsers, but it’s clunky
  and ugly
- The new fetch API is much better, but it is not supported on Internet Explorer
- If you want to develop a real-world App using fetch, you can download an
  external library (polyfill) to add fetch support for those browsers that don’t
  already have it
- Eventually, all browsers will support fetch and this will not be necessary any
  more
- [JavaScript Polyfills for the fetch api](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/625/top-5-best-javascript-polyfills-for-the-fetch-api)

## Anatomy of the Fetch Statement

The code in helloAjax.js attaches a click listener to the button that contains
the following code.

```js
fetch("hello.txt", /* URL (relative to current path) */ {
  credentials: "include",
}) /* options (object literal) */
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then(success /* success function */);
```

- This launches a GET request for the file "hello.txt", and then calls the
  function named success when the HTTP Response is received
- The success function is sometimes referred to as a callback function
- The fetch function is asynchronous (the A in Ajax), meaning that it performs
  its work in the background
- The rest of the code can continue to run while we wait for the callback
  function to get called
- The success function will be called when the response is received
- It should accept a single parameter, which will contain the text of the
  response
- The success function for helloAjax looks like this:

```js
function success(text) {
  let span = document.getElementById("target");
  span.innerHTML = text;
  console.log(text); // debug
}
```

- In practice, you can just cut and paste the above code, then modify the URL
  and the success function to suit your needs

## Sending GET Parameters

- An Ajax request to hello.php along with a request parameter
- The text for the parameter comes from a text box on the web page
- Since it uses a GET request, the parameters are encoded into the URL

```js
let url = "hello.php?nameparam=" + name;
console.log(url); // debug
fetch(url, { credentials: "include" })
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then(success);
```

- The PHP program hello.php is a little different than the other php programs we
  have looked at
- This one does not have to produce a complete web page
- It only echoes the text that we want to send back to the JavaScript program

```php
<?php
$name = filter_input(
    INPUT_GET,
    "nameparam",
    FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS
);

echo "Hello, <strong>$name</strong>!!!";
// ...
?>
```

- Sending POST parameters is a bit trickier, but in practice you rarely need to
  use POST since the parameters will never be seen by the user
- See the optional section at the end for more information on POST

## Fetching JSON Data

- In the examples so far, the PHP scripts have been responding to Ajax requests
  with plain text
- But most apps need to retrieve structured data from the server (e.g. an array
  of strings containing suggestions for a Google search, or an array of objects
  representing items in a Twitter feed)
- But HTTP can only transmit strings, so to accomplish this, we need a way of
  translating data structures into strings and back again
- When the term _"AJAX"_ was invented, everyone was using XML to encode data
  structures, but these days most people use JSON
- JSON stands for _"JavaScript Object Notation"_
- It’s a way to encode a data structure as a string
- Even though the word _"JavaScript"_ is used in the JSON acronym, the JSON
  format is language independent
- A PHP program (or a program in any other language) can create a JSON string to
  represent an object and then pass that string to a JavaScript program

## The Fetch Chain for JSON

- If you know you are receive JSON data, you can just change the text method
  call in the fetch statement to a json method call, like this:

```js
fetch(url, { credentials: "include" })
  .then((response) => response.json()) // Convert from JSON
  .then(success);
```

- Now the success function will receive a JavaScript data structure instead of
  the original text of the HTTP Response
- So you’d better be sure that you’re sending a JSON-encoded string from your
  PHP program, otherwise you will see errors in the JavaScript console

## Echoing JSON from a PHP Program

- Launch a request for an array of random integers
- Look in the Network tab to see the JSON-encoded response from the server, and
  look in the Console tab to see the array that was received
- The PHP program creates an array and then echoes it into the response, but it
  encodes it as a JSON string first:

```php
<?php
$min = filter_input(INPUT_GET, "min", FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
$max = filter_input(INPUT_GET, "max", FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
$num = filter_input(INPUT_GET, "num", FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);

// Create the array
$result = [];
for ($i=0; $i<$num; $i++) {
    array_push($result, rand($min,$max));
}

// Convert to JSON and echo, methods will not get encoded
echo json_encode($result);
// ...
?>
```

## Receiving JSON from a PHP Program

- In the getjson.js file, an AJAX request is sent with a fetch statement that
  uses the json method to decode the data
- Then the success function receives the decoded array of integers

```js
function success(a) { // The "a" parameter contains an array
  let span = document.getElementById("target");
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    sum += a[i];
  }

  let avg = sum / a.length;
  span.innerHTML = "average value: " + avg;
}
```

## Fetching from a Database

- Fetch an array of objects from a database into a JavaScript program
- Note that to run the code in this section, you’ll have to import grades.sql
  into your local database.

### The PHP File

- Create an array of objects in PHP
- Each "object" is actually just an associative array so we’re actually creating
  an array of associative arrays
- When the JavaScript program receives and decodes the result, it becomes an
  array of objects
- This works because JavaScript objects are actually just associative arrays

```php
$userlist = [];
while ($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
    $user = [
        // For JSON, there is no difference between an associative array and an object
        "firstname" => $row["firstname"],
        "lastname" => $row["lastname"],
        // The database always returns strings, so ints and floats have to be cast
        "finalexam" => (int) $row["final_exam"]
    ];
    array_push($userlist, $user);
}

echo json_encode($userlist);
```

### The Success Function

- An AJAX request is sent with a fetch statement that uses the json method to
  decode the data
- Then the success function receives the data as an array of objects

```js
function success(users) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    // The array of associative arrays can be treated like an array of objects
    sum += users[i].finalexam;
  }

  let avg = sum / users.length;
  let span = document.getElementById("target");
  span.innerHTML = "Average Grade: " + avg;
}
```

## Sending POST Parameters with Fetch

- Send two parameters that specify a numeric range using a POST request
- For this, we need to specify a few more options
- First, we need to specify that we’re using the POST method
- POST parameters are sent in the body of the HTTP Request and there are a
  number of possible formats, so we need to specify which one we are using by
  setting a `Content-Type` header in the request

```js
let params = "min=" + min + "&" + "max=" + max; // "&" Separates request parameters
fetch("random.php", {
  method: "POST", // Using POST, not GET
  credentials: "include",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" }, // The headers parameter also requires an object literal
  body: params, // Request parameters go in the body of the request
})
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then(success);
```

- The PHP file receives the parameters and echoes a random number in the
  specified range

```php
<?php
    $min = filter_input(INPUT_POST, "min", FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
    $max = filter_input(INPUT_POST, "max", FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
    echo rand($min, $max);
    // ...
?>
```

## A Deeper Dive into Fetch Syntax

### The Options Object

- The second parameter to the fetch call above is an object literal
- In JavaScript, when a method has a large number of optional parameters, it is
  quite common to have the user specify them using the instance variables of an
  object
- You can create the object any way you like
- For example, we could have done this instead:

```js
let options = {};
options.credentials = "include";

fetch("hello.txt", options)
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then(success);
```

- In JavaScript, an object is just an associative array
- Its instance variable and method names are really just string indices
- In fact, anywhere in JavaScript that you can use the dot notation to access
  instance variables, you can use associative array notation instead
- For example, the following all equivalent in JavaScript:

```js
node.style.color = "blue";
node.style["color"] = "blue";
node["style"]["color"] = "blue";
node["style"].color = "blue";
```

- Many JavaScript programmers actually prefer to use associative array notation
  for the style object because it allows you to use the original hyphenated CSS
  property names e.g.:

```js
node.style["background-color"]);
```

- If you try to access an instance variable (or associative array key) that
  doesn’t exist, the result is undefined
- A function like fetch that receives an object full of instance variables as an
  argument could just check to see which of the keys it was expecting are
  defined, or it could unpack it using JavaScript’s version of the enhanced for
  loop
- Try this in the JavaScript console:

```js
a = { x: 5, y: 2, z: 4 };
for (key in a) {
  console.log(key + "->" + a[key]);
}
```

### { credentials: 'include' }

- For most GET requests, you probably don’t need to specify
  `{ credentials: 'include' }`, but we’re going to make a habit of always using
  it
- It forces the fetch method to send authorization headers
- and cookies when it sends the HTTP Request
- Not including them can lead to errors in some cases

### Promises, Chaining, and Arrow Functions

- The fetch function returns a special kind of object called a Promise
- You can use a Promise’s `then` method to specify a function that should be run
  when the "promise" is fulfilled
- This allows Ajax requests to be asynchronous
- The browser and your code can continue to run and respond to other events
  during the seconds or minutes it takes for the request to complete
- When the fetch function has finished what it promised to do, it calls the
  function you specify in the `then` method to process its result
- The `then` function also returns a Promise
- So you can attach another function using another `then` method call
- This is called chaining
- When the first Promise is fulfilled, it calls its `then` function
- Whatever that function returns gets passed to the next `then` function, and so
  on down the line
- As is customary when using the fetch API, the first `then` method specifies a
  function using the compact arrow function expression syntax

```js
((response) => response.text());
```

- For most uses, the above syntax is equivalent to the following function
  literal:

```js
function(response) { return response.text(); }
```

- Arrow functions (also called _Lambda Expressions_) come from the **Functional
  Programming** paradigm, but are now available for use in most **imperative**
  and **object-oriented** languages as well (Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, etc)
- The arrow function is called by the Promise object created in the fetch
  function
- The arrow function receives a Response object as a parameter
- This object contains within it all the header and body information from the
  original HTTP Response
- The arrow function calls the Response object’s text method to extract the text
  of the response and returns it to be passed as a parameter to the success
  method

## JSON Encoding and Decoding in JavaScript and PHP

- Both JavaScript and PHP contain methods to both encode and decode JSON strings

| Script     | Encode to JSON         | Decode from JSON  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| JavaScript | `JSON.stringify(data)` | `JSON.parse(s)`   |
| PHP        | `json_encode($data)`   | `json_decode($s)` |

- Try this in the Chrome JavaScript Console to create a couple of objects in an
  array called data

```js
// These are quick ways to create objects in JavaScript
let object1 = {};
object1.x = 3;
object1.z = 5;

let object2 = { x: -1, y: -2, z: -3 };
let data = [object1, object2];

// You can create a JSON string to encode this data like this:
let encoding = JSON.stringify(data);

// The encoding should look like this:
// '[{"x":3,"y":4,"z":5},{"x":-1,"y":-2,"z":-3}]'

// Then you can re-create a copy the original array of objects from the encoding like this:
let data2 = JSON.parse(encoding);

// Now you can access the objects
// Logs the x field of the first object in the array:
console.log(data2[0].x);
```
