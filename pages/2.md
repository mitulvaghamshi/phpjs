# HTML & CSS

- The list below should help you create a basic, user-friendly interface
  - **Vocabulary**: element, empty element, tag, attribute, property, value,
    selector
  - **HTML Elements**: p, a, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, div, span, img, ul, ol, li,
    table, tr, td, form, input, link, style, comment
  - **HTML Attributes**: href, src, id, class
  - **CSS Properties**: color (rgb, rgba, hash codes, color names),
    background-color, fonts, font-size, font-weight, font-family, padding (px,
    %), margin(margin:auto), width, max-width, height, border (and
    box-sizing:border-box), float, clear, display (inline, block, inline-block)
  - **CSS Selectors**: tag, class, id, :hover

## Respect the HTML/CSS Division of Labor

- Never choose an HTML element based on what it looks like in the default
  browser style
- Choose an element based on what kind of thing it is
- Use `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` for a top level heading, `<ul>`for a list,
  etc
- HTML creates the structure of a document
- HTML tags are used to label something as a paragraph, a heading, a link, a
  table row, a list, or a logical division in the document (div)
- CSS creates the look of a document
- CSS rules give you complete control over how an element looks in the browser
- The navigation section is in a `<ul>` element
- The `<ul>` element was chosen because of what the content is (a list of
  links), even though most browsers would present this by default as a bulleted
  list
- CSS rules were used toturn this **list** into a set of user-friendly buttons

## Think Small

- Make sure your app looks good on a small browser
- Apps that are tuned to wide browsers tend to look terrible on small browsers
- Try to use CSS to make your apps look good on a small, tablet-sized screen
  (768 pixels wide at most)

## Think Flexible

- When specifying the widths of elements, use `%` instead of `px`
- Make `<div>` elements narrow and then use `float:left` to allow them to stack
  up on different sized screens
- Use `max-width` on your main containing `<div>` so that the container will
  resize but will not allow itself to get too wide, and use `margin:auto` to
  keep it centered on a wide screen
- Don’t use `position:absolute` except as an **absolute** last resort

## Use a CSS Reset Rule

- Use a CSS reset rule to override default browser styles, especially the box
  model properties (margin, padding, border)
- That way whatever browser the client is using, all your CSS rules proceed from
  the same starting point
- The `*` selector applies this rule to all elements

```css
* {
    border: 0;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

## Form Layout Elements

- The `<fieldset>` tag is used to group input elements and by default puts a
  border around them
- It’s not really different from any other semantic tag except that you can use
  a `<legend>` tag to embed text into the border

```html
<fieldset>
    <legend>Your Coordinates</legend>
    <!-- Web: -->
    <input type="url" required  placeholder="http://"><br>
    <!-- Email: -->
    <input type="email" required placeholder="user@example.com">
</fieldset>
```

## Radio Buttons

- Radio buttons are round buttons that are grouped together so that only one can
  be selected at a time (e.g. male or female; faculty, staff or student; etc)
- The following code defines a set of radio buttons for choosing a dog breed:

```html
<input type="radio" name="breed" value="terrier"> <!-- Terrier -->
<input type="radio" name="breed" value="poodle"> <!-- Poodle -->
<input type="radio" name="breed" value="bull"> <!-- Bulldog -->
<input type="radio" name="breed" value="hound"> <!-- Blood Hound -->
```

- Each input element creates a small round button
- Because they all have the same name attribute, only one can be selected at a
  time
- When the form is submitted, there will be a single breed parameter with one of
  the values listed
- If the user does not select any of the options, the breed parameter will not
  be sent
- To have one of the buttons selected by default, include a checked attribute,
  as shown below

```html
<input type="radio" name="breed" value="poodle" checked>
```

- If you use the required attribute on any button in a set, it will force the
  user to choose one

## Checkboxes

- Checkboxes are like radio buttons, but they are square and the user is allowed
  to check more than one
- The following code defines a set of checkboxes for selecting hobbies:

```html
<input type="checkbox" name="hobby_read"> <!-- Reading -->
<input type="checkbox" name="hobby_hike"> <!-- Hiking -->
<input type="checkbox" name="hobby_swim"> <!-- Swimming -->
<input type="checkbox" name="hobby_music"> <!-- Music -->
```

- Each input element creates a small square button
- When the form is submitted there will be between 0 and 4 parameters submitted
- Each will have the same name (hobby) but each will have a different value
- If you want to pre-select some options for the user, include the checked
  attribute in each element that you want to be pre-selected
- If you want to force someone to check a particular box (e.g. "I have read and
  understood the terms of service") use the required attribute

## Labels for Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

- Radio buttons and checkboxes are small and hard to click
- It’s always nice to allow the user to click not only on the button but on the
  text beside the button as well (i.e. its "label")

```html
<input type="radio" name="breed" value="terrier" id="terrier">
<label for="terrier">Terrier</label>
```

- In the above, note that the `<input>` element has to have a unique id
  attribute (in addition to a name) and the id must match the for attribute of
  the label
- This works in the same way for check boxes as well
- It is more work but it’s worth it to the user!
- For more info go to http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp

## Text Areas

- Sometimes the user needs to enter lots and lots of text
- That’s what a `<textarea>` element is for

```html
<textarea name="essay"></textarea>
```

- `<input>` elements are empty tags, but `<textarea>` is not
- You must include a closing tag, even if you don’t want to add default text to
  the box
- If you want to pre-fill the text area, you put text between the open and
  closing tags
- Don’t try to do it with a value attribute

```html
<textarea name="essay">
The text here will pre-fill the text area
</textarea>
```

- You can also specify the default height and width of a text area in rows and
  columns:

```html
<textarea name="essay" rows="10" cols="80">
This text area has 10 rows and 80 columns, though some browsers allow you the user to resize a text area
</textarea>
```

- Other parameters you can use include required, autofocus, placeholder, etc

## Drop Down Lists

- Sometimes you might want to give the user choices in a drop down list
- These lists are created using the `<select>` and `<option>` tags, like this:

```html
<select name="occupation">
    <option value="student">I’m a Student</option>
    <option value="worker">I’m a Worker</option>
    <option value="capitalist">I’m a Capitalist</option>
    <option value="unemployed">I’m Unemployed</option>
    <option value="middle">I’m a Small Business Owner</option>
</select>
```

- You can use the required and autofocus attributes on the `<select>` element
- If you use the multiple attribute on the `<select>` element, the user will be
  able to select more than one item
- If you don’t specify a value for an option, the value will be the same as what
  the user sees
- The first option will be preselected unless you include a selected attribute
  on one of the other options
- You can also group the options using an `<optgroup>` tag with a label
  attribute
- For more info go to http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_optgroup.asp

## Data Lists

- If you define a `<datalist>` in your document, you can use it to create
  autocomplete options that will help a user fill out a text box
- The options will pop up as they type or if they click twice in the box

```html
<input type="text" list="breeds">

<datalist id="breeds">
    <option>Poodle</option>
    <option>Bulldog</option>
    <option>Terrier</option>
</datalist>
```

- Note that in the above, the `<input>` element has a list attribute that
  matches the id of the `<datalist>` element
- The `<datalist>` element works with a variety of input types

```html
<input type="range" list="points" min="0" max="100">

<datalist id="points">
    <option>25</option>
    <option>50</option>
    <option>75</option>
    <option>100</option>
</datalist>
```

# Bootstrap

- A front-end web development framework
- Developed at Twitter to encourage consistency across internal tools
- Released in 2011, updated consistently since then
- Second-most starred project on GitHub, very popular with web developers!
- See [documentation and download](https://getbootstrap.com)
- There's a few ways to obtain it depending on the project type...
- But the easiest way is to just use the
  [starter template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)

## Front-end frameworks

- Provide pre-defined css classes
- Allow us to style web apps in a common way
- Provide predefined components that provide some specific functionality
- Typically a set of CSS classes, maybe supported by JavaScript code, along with
  associated expectations around how they are to be used in HTML tags
- E.g. drop-down lists, navigation bars, pagination
- Extensive example code and tutorials make it easy to integrate into our own
  applications

## Front-end framework advantages

- Development time
  - Not re-inventing the wheel, leveraging existing work
- Reliability
  - An entire community to find and fix bugs
- Cross-compatibility
  - So many browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc), devices (laptop, desktop,
    tablet, phone), and screen sizes!
  - How can a small development team possibly test across all these possible
    combinations?
  - Latest version of Bootstrap will ensure cross-compatibility

## User interface design advantages

- Framework is tried and tested by millions and so it is known to be
  well-received, what you make may not be!
- Learnability and ease-of-use
  - Users are familiar with the interface components and style from having
    recognized it before on Twitter and other websites
  - Some argue this is a bad thing for branding purposes, but for the most part
    this isn't true, imagine how confusing it would be if every Windows app used
    completely different buttons, menus, and drop-downs?

## Bootstrap - Versions

- Version 5 released in May 2021
- Version 5 notably dropped jQuery dependency
- Versions 3 and 4 are still heavily used in industry and by employers
- Part of an [industry trend](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com) towards dropping
  jQuery dependencies in libraries
- Version honestly doesn't matter, it will change again soon, the idea of using
  pre-defined classes and components in structured ways is what matters!

## Bootstrap - Grid System

- Grid system is the most important part of responsive design with Bootstrap
- Rows made up of up to 12 columns, that can be grouped together to create wider
  columns
- Grid system
  - A responsive grid system that scales up to 12 columns of information to the
    appropriate device size
  - A row is used to define a horizontal group of columns
  - Content is places inside the columns
  - Only columns may be immediate children of rows
  - Pre-defined grid classes like .col-xs-4 let us quickly make grid layouts,
    but we can customize our own
  - The 4 part of the pre-defined class tell us that the column using this class
    will span 4 of the 12 columns
- [See documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid)

## Bootstrap - Containers

- Bootstrap contents, including grid systems, require a containing element:

```html
<div class="container"><!-- ... --></div>
```

- Bootstrap containers can be fixed with (as above) or fluid:

```html
<div class="container-fluid"><!-- ... --></div>
```

- Fluid width containers won't necessarily stack, columns will just get smaller
- [All Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components)

## Responsive utilities

- Display utility classes can be used to
  [hide and un-hide elements](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/display/#hiding-elements)
  based on the screen size

```css
.d-{breakpoint}-{value}
```

- Breakpoint is sm, md, lg, xl
- Value is none, inline, inline-block, block, etc
- The media queries effect screen widths with the given breakpoint or larger
- Need to combine them to do things like only display elements on certain screen
  sizes

## Responsive ratio

- Class [ratio](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/helpers/ratio) allows for
  embedding content that maintains the ratio across screen sizes
- `ratio-AxB` maintains AxB aspect ratio
