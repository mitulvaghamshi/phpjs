# Data Validation

- Web app designers face special concerns when it comes to protecting their apps
  and their user’s data from online vandals and burglars
- This module presents an overview of some of the main security issues facing
  web app designers along with some coding practices and tools that can help to
  mitigate these threats

## The Danger of User Input

- Server-side PHP programs routinely receive input from users through HTTP
  Request parameters sent from HTML forms
- They take this user input and incorporate it into web pages and SQL queries
- In other words, user input is used to write code that gets executed on the
  client or server machine
- If programmers are not careful about how they handle this user input, they
  open their apps to various kinds of attacks
- One common kind of attack is code injection

## HTML Code Injection

- For example, App receives an HTTP Request parameter called param and echoes it
  to the page without using `filter_input` to sanitize it first
- To see why this is a problem, try the GET parameter show below in the URL:

```html
example.php?param=<script>location.reload()</script>
```

- This benign hack causes a JavaScript command to be injected into the HTML code
  for the page
- The command refreshes the page as soon as it’s loaded, effectively disabling
  it and wasting browser cycles and bandwidth
- At the time of writing, this hack works on Firefox and IE but not on Chrome,
  which is smart enough to detect it (check the messages in the Chrome Developer
  Console)

## The Problem: $_GET

```php
echo "<p>$_GET['param']</p>";
```

- The above statement is retrieving the request parameter from a superglobal
  associative array called `$_GET` instead of using `filter_input` to do the
  retrieval
- The superblogal `$_POST` is also available for post parameters and `$_REQUEST`
  contains all get and post parameters together as well as any cookies received
  with the request
- These variables are the oldest and most established ways of receiving
  parameters in PHP

## The Solution: Validate and Sanitize

- The fix for the code injection problem above is easy: sanitize the parameter
  using `filter_input` before placing it on the page
- It is not susceptible to this code injection
- There are other ways to sanitize and validate your parameters but
  `filter_input` is considered a best practice solution by many programmers
  because it allows you to avoid using `$_GET` and `$_POST` anywhere in your
  code
- If you never access these variables directly, then it is much less likely that
  you will accidentally expose yourself to a code injection attack

## The Problem of Run-time Errors

- Making sure you always use `filter_input` with the correct filter type and
  check its return value will also insulate your code from run-time errors
- Run-time errors are to be avoided because they can lead to a negative user
  experience, but they can also sometimes tip off a clever hacker about other
  vulnerabilities in your system
- For example, if your server is configured to display error messages and you
  access the `$_POST` array looking for a userid parameter, the user might see
  something like the message below

```
Notice: Undefined index: `userid` in `https:\\example.com\library\utilities.php` on line 2
```

- This error exposes:
  - The language this part of the app is written in,
  - The name of the parameter it receives,
  - The URL of one of the PHP files involved in the app (which might not have
    been visible if it was loaded using an include statement)
- All of this information could be used by a clever hacker to figure out a way
  to gain unauthorized access to your app or your user data
- For this reason, most production servers turn off error reporting entirely
- Error reporting is used only during development, and only on internal
  development servers
- (We have left error reporting active on CSUnix only because it is used for
  teaching and learning.) Still, any server can be accidentally misconfigured,
  so you should always avoid any possibility of run-time errors to avoid
  exposing vulnerabilities to a malicious user

## SQL Code Injection Attacks

- Use PDO to prepare and execute statements with parameters (i.e question marks)
  that get filled in, often using HTTP Request Parameters, when you execute
- But an alternative and very dangerous practice would be to simply concatenate
  data from the user directly into the command string

```php
$id = filter_input(INPUT_POST, "id", FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS);
// User input concatenated directly into the SQL command string
$deletecommand = "DELETE FROM MyTable WHERE ID=$id";
$stmt = $dbh->prepare($deletecommand);
$stmt->execute();
```

- The code above is vulnerable to an **SQL Injection attack** in which a hacker
  types some SQL syntax into your form which then gets concatenated (i.e.
  injected) into your SQL command string and wreaks havoc on your database
- A simple attack on the code above would be for the user to send a pollid
  parameter set to something like "1 OR 1"
- In that case the command string becomes

```sql
DELETE FROM MyTable WHERE ID = 1 OR 1;
```

- Since 1 is interpreted as TRUE in SQL, the above is equivalent to:

```sql
DELETE FROM MyTable WHERE (ID = 1) OR (TRUE);
```

- The WHERE clause evaluates to TRUE for every row, so every row in the table
  gets deleted
- Using other SQL Injection attacks, a clever hacker might be able to retrieve
  passwords or other sensitive data, login as an administrator, etc

## How Do Parameters Help?

- One way to think of the difference between using prepared statement parameters
  and just concatenating the command string together is that the prepare method
  compiles the command into a function which accepts an argument and executes
  the command using that argument
- Let’s call the function created by the prepare method in the above example
  `deleteById`
- Then if $id contains the string “1 OR 1” the execute statement in the above
  example calls `deleteById` like this:

```js
deleteById("1 OR 1");
```

- The function goes to the database looking for rows with id set to "1 OR 1"
- Since there are no such rows, the function deletes nothing
- The parameter helped because input from the user was treated as data rather
  than being executed as code
- This SQL Injection example could also have been neutralized using
  `FILTER_VALIDATE_INT` instead of `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS` because
  "1 OR 1" is not an integer and would have caused `filter_input` to return
  false
- To be as safe as possible, it is a best practice to use the correct input
  filter and also use parameters in the SQL query string as well
- If multiple lines of defense are always in place, then all the code you write
  will be safer

## Client Side Validation

- The story so far is that you must validate and sanitize all the data coming
  into your server, and you must use prepared statement parameters for SQL so
  that your code is not vulnerable to injection attacks and other possible hacks
- But what if we carefully construct HTML forms and use HTML attributes and
  JavaScript event listeners to validate the forms and prevent the user from
  submitting invalid data in the first place?
- For example, an HTML form could:
  - use the required attribute on an `<input>` element to prevent empty
    parameters,
  - use type="number", type="email", etc
  - to force a parameter into the proper format,
  - use a `<select>` element to force the user to pick from a list of valid
    choices,
  - use JavaScript event listeners on the submit, input, or change events can to
    catch other issues, even as the user types
- Using all the above tricks and more, you can lock down the user very
  effectively
- But unfortunately, client-side validation is not enough to make your app safe
  from attack
- The server has no way of knowing where an HTTP Request is coming from or how
  it was created
- A clever user can enter the browser’s developer tools to turn off all the
  client-side validation, or create their own HTTP Request using a form or
  script written for that purpose

## But client-side validation is still important for other reasons

- Client-side validation creates a nicer user experience
  - Users will not have to wait for a page load to find out they have submitted
    bad data, and with JavaScript, you can alert them to problems as they fill
    in the form
  - Client-side validation minimizes wasted resources by preventing HTTP
    Requests containing invalid data
  - Every bad HTTP Request wastes bandwidth and processing time on the server,
    which has to create the HTTP Response, run scripts, and possibly execute
    database queries for the invalid request
- The bottom line is that you must validate user input on both the server-side
  and the clientside of your app

## Hiding Sensitive Information

- Sensitive information should be kept hidden as much as possible, even from
  trusted employees
- Passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data should not be visible
  on the device, should not be visible in transmission, and should not even be
  visible in the database or anywhere else on the server

## Hiding Information on the Device

- Hiding information on the device means making sure that people and
  surveillance devices in the user’s environment do not have a view of it

## Masking

- Masking information means blocking all or part of it when displaying it on the
  page
- Passwords can be masked using an `<input>` element with `type="password"`
- This shows the length of the password, but not its contents
- JavaScript event listeners can also be used to capture inputs and change the
  value attribute, masking the length of the password as well
- Credit card numbers should be masked, but in practice, it is frustrating for
  the user to not be able to see a long number while entering it
- So, most apps do not mask during initial entry but do mask most of the credit
  card number when echoing it for confirmation

## POST Parameters

- Sensitive information should always be sent using an HTTP Post Request
- This does not keep the information safe from hackers, but it does stop the
  information from being viewed, bookmarked, copied, and pasted can be seen by
  anyone nearby

## Hiding Information in Transmission

- Any site that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is sending plain text
  data over an unencrypted connection
- This information might pass through dozens of servers on its way to its
  destination, where it may get copied, cached, and harvested by malicious users
- Using HTTP Post Requests does not hide data during transmission – anything you
  can see by viewing a request in the Network tab of the Chrome Developer Tools
  can also be seen during transmission if the request uses HTTP
- The solution is to use the HTTPS protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
  when sending sensitive data
- This forces the browser and the server to exchange their public encryption
  keys which are used to turn every message into unreadable cryptographic code
- Decoding requires private encryption keys, which the server and browser keep
  to themselves
- Encryption keys are integers, usually presented in hexadecimal
- At the time of writing, the public key for https://wikipedia.com was:

```
04 67 75 ad 2e c6 6a e3 31 27 5e 41 99 58 92 86 35 4c 8f 04 09 36 38 f0 f8 e5 21 9c 86 aa 13 94 05 fe ae 9c fc b2 2f 56 1e 0d df 8e f7 6b b2 79 d8 97 1f 9a 57 c2 ad 7b c3 b6 11 f3 69 93 44 9d e2
```

- The above key was obtained by clicking on the padlock icon next to the address
  bar in Chrome and selecting the certificate (see figure at right)
- Messages encrypted using a public key are not uncrackable but cracking them
  requires figuring out the private key that goes with the public key
- The sophisticated mathematical used to generate the keys ensure that solving
  this problem is intractable for most users
- They can figure out the private key in theory, but the computations involved
  will take many years even on the fastest available machines
- In order to use HTTPS for your web app, you have to do two things:
  - Obtain an SSL Certificate containing a public key, issued by a trusted
    authority
  - Redirect users from HTTP to HTTPS

## Obtaining an SSL Certificate

- An SSL Certificate is a data file that the server sends to the client for
  verification
- It contains the server’s public key and domain name and is signed by a trusted
  authority that issued the certificate
- If the certificate is valid and the client trusts the authority that issued
  it, then it will initiate communications using HTTPS
- Otherwise, the user may find themselves blocked with a security warning from
  their browser
- Most web hosting services will either include an SSL Certificate for free or
  charge a bit extra to obtain and install one for you

## Redirecting to HTTPS

- It’s not a good idea to not supporting HTTP to users of real apps, who will
  often not type `https://` when entering an address, leaving the default
  `http://` protocol to be filled in by their browser
- But if you support both protocols, then you’ll have to do something to
  redirect naïve users to the secure version of your site
- The site `example.com` supports both protocols and does not redirect
- Try these links and look for the padlock icon in the address bar in each case:
  - http://example.com
  - https://example.com
- On the other hand, if you try to go to http://google.com, you will immediately
  be redirected to https://google.com and your searches, logins, etc
- will all be encrypted and safe for transmission
- There are a number of ways to accomplish this redirection
- At the server level, URL rewriting often does the job
- On an Apache server (e.g. XAMPP) you can include URL rewriting rules in a
  special file called `.htaccess` in the `public_html` folder

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```

- The above code directs the server to check for HTTPS in the URL of every HTTP
  Request
- That’s the `RewriteCond` (Rewrite Condition) line above
- If HTTPS is not found (i.e. it’s "off"), the `RewriteRule` is executed
- This rule instructs the server to send a response back to the browser
  including the HTTPS version of the URL and with a status of 301, which means
  that this site has moved permanently
- The browser then launches a new request to the HTTPS URL
- You can see all this happening in the Network tab of the Chrome Developer
  tools when you launch a request for google, facebook, or any other major site
  using the HTTP protocol
- You might have to use the incognito browser to see it, though, because 301
  responses may cause the browser to remember the rewritten URL and
  automatically translate future requests

## Hiding Information on the Server

- Masking, POST parameters, and HTTPS prevent user data from being seen on the
  device and during transmission, but further steps must still be taken to make
  sure that the information is hidden from prying eyes on your servers

## Strong Server Passwords

- All server passwords must be strong and kept secret
- This includes database user passwords (for phpMyAdmin and connect.php) as well
  as FTP and remote login passwords
- They are your first line of defense against hackers who would steal your
  users’ data
- PhpMyAdmin contains tools for generating secure passwords, as shown below

## Session Storage

- Never store passwords or credit card numbers in the `$_SESSION` object
- Information that you place here will eventually be cached in plain text
  session files on the server for later retrieval
- Anyone with access to the server will be able to retrieve the information in
  these files
- Facebook recently caught themselves in exactly this situation:
  - https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/keeping-passwords-secure

## Database Storage

- You should not store plaintext sensitive information in your database either
- Passwords should not be visible to intruders who have broken into your system,
  nor even to your trusted employees
- Credit card numbers should be encrypted before storage and only decrypted when
  necessary

## Hashing and Salting Passwords

- Passwords are stored using a kind of one-way encryption known as hashing
- A hashing function turns a password into an unrecognizable series of
  characters
- It’s a one-way function there’s no reliable way to get back the original
  password from the hash
- When the user registers, you hash their password and store the hashed version
  in your database
- When they log in again, you hash the password they entered in the login form
  and check it against the hashed password stored in the database
- When passwords are handled in this way, no attacker or employee will ever see
  an unencrypted user password
- Knowing the hashed password is not helpful because you need the original
  password to log in and you can’t get that from the hashed version
- Although it’s not easy to compute the original password from its hashed
  version, it is possible to precompute hash codes for a list of common or known
  passwords and then look up hashed passwords to find the original
- A table of passwords and their hashed versions is called a rainbow table
- Modern hashing algorithms also use a process called salting to prevent
  attackers using this technique
- Salting makes this much more difficult by adding a random string of characters
  (the salt) to each password so that the hashed version in the database is not
  a direct hash of the original password, but of the salted version of the
  password
- In PHP, you can use the password_hash function to generate a hashed and salted
  version of a string to store in the database
- When the user attempts a login, you can retrieve the hashed password from the
  database, and then check it against what the user typed into the login form
  using `password_verify`

## Hashing a New Password for Storage

```php
// This is what gets stored in the database
$hash = password_hash(
    $user_password, // Original password entered by the user
    PASSWORD_DEFAULT // Hashed and salted using the best algorithm available (the default one)
);

if (password_verify( // Verifying a Password to Log a User In
    $userpwd, // Original password entered by the user
    $hash // Hashed and salted version from the database
)) {
    // granted
}
```
