# SQL

- Most web apps involve a database on the server side to store user information,
  product information, shopping cart contents, orders, game histories, trophies,
  badges, high scores, etc
- Since the database is on the server, a server-side scripting language is used
  to retrieve, update, and store information in the database in response to
  requests from the client
- The most common type of database for web apps is a relational database
  implementing SQL

## What are SQL and MySQL?

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL is a standardized language for talking to a relational database
- SQL is considered a 4th Generation Language (4GL)
- SQL is a declarative language. You use it to declare what you want done, but
  not how the system should do it
- MySQL is relational database management system (DBMS) that implements SQL
- There are many other DBMS’s that also implement SQL

## What is a Relational Database?

- A relational database is a set of tables and relations
- A database table has rows and columns
- Each row is a record in the database, and each column is a field
- A row is like an object and the columns are like the instance variables of the
  object
- The fields (columns) have types associated with them.
- SQL commands can be used to insert, delete, update or select rows from a table

## Important SQL Commands

- The four basic operations on the rows of a table are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
  and DELETE
- You’ll create and configure your tables in phpMyAdmin
- The four operations are summarized below
- Square brackets indicate optional parts of the query. An ellipsis (...)
  indicates that you can use a comma-separated list
- The word condition must be replaced by a Boolean expression using field names,
  values, AND, OR, and NOT

```sql
SELECT field...
FROM table
[WHERE condition]
[ORDER BY field [DESC] ...]
[LIMIT n]
-- SELECT * gets you all the fields

INSERT INTO table (column...)
VALUES (value...)
-- String values must be quoted using single quotes

UPDATE table
SET field=value...
[WHERE condition]

-- You can do arithmetic using field names
UPDATE table
SET field1=field2+field3
WHERE field4 > 10

DELETE FROM table
[WHERE condition]
```

## Primary Keys

- Every table should have a column marked as the primary key
- The primary key is forced to be unique and allows you to select individual
  rows
- The primary key column often has **ID** in its name somewhere

## MySQL and PhpMyAdmin

- MySQL is a popular, free relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that
  implements SQL
- PhpMyAdmin is a tool to manipulate MySQL databases through a web interface
- It’s written in PHP

## PhpMyAdmin on XAMPP

- You can log in to the XAMPP phpMyAdmin using http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/
- No login information is required
- You will use the XAMPP MySQL server to develop your apps locally, then upload
  your app and its database tables to Server

## Creating a New Table

- Click the database name
- Below the list of tables is a form to create a new table
- Fill in the name and number of columns for the new table, then press **GO**
- You will see a row for each field
- You must fill in the name and type of each field
- Choose VARCHAR for text and INT for integers
- If you choose VARCHAR, you must specify a maximum LENGTH
- You must have a Primary Key
- Set INDEX to PRIMARY
- The Primary Key will usually be of type INT (but not always)
- Check A_I (Auto-Increment) for an INT primary key so you don’t have to specify
  a value when inserting
- Most of the other options can be left blank but here are two you might want to
  use
- Set a default value (e.g. "As Defined: 0")
- When you’re done, press SAVE below the form

## Modify an Existing Table

- Go to the BROWSE tab to see the contents of the table o You can delete records
  here and modify records by double clicking values
- Go to the INSERT tab to add new records
- Go to the STRUCTURE tab to add, remove or modify the fields

## Use the SQL Tab

- The SQL tab allows you to execute SQL commands
- Use it to test your SQL syntax before including commands into your php
  programs

## Export & Import (backup & restore)

- Click on the table name (not the database name!)
- Go to the EXPORT tab
- Press GO to create a `.sql` file that can be IMPORTed into another DB

## PHP Data Objects (PDO)

- When a web app logs a user in, displays their trophies, or displays a list of
  products and allows a them to add products to a shopping cart, it is usually
  interacting with a database
- A server-side program communicates with the database by sending it SQL
  commands, then writes the results into the web page
- In PHP, the latest and best way of accomplishing this is to use PHP Data
  Objects (PDO)
- Note: the w3Schools pages show you two methods for interacting with databases:
  Mysqli and PDO
- In the sections below, you’ll see how to connect to the database from a PHP
  program, and how to issue UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT queries
- SELECT queries are a little bit more complicated, so we’ll leave them until
  later

## How to Issue SQL Queries

- To issue queries UPDATE, DELETE or INSERT commands from a PHP script, there
  are 4 steps

### 1. Establish a connection by creating a database handler object

- Your login id is `"root"` and your password is the empty string `""`.

```php
try {
    $dbh = new PDO(
        "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=dbname",
        "username", "password"
    );
} catch (Exception $e) {
    die("ERROR: Couldn't connect. {$e->getMessage()}");
}
```

### 2. Prepare the statement

- You prepare (compile) an SQL command string by calling the prepare method of
  the database handler object
- This method returns a statement object containing the compiled version of the
  command
- Your original command string should contain question marks instead of data
  values
- The question marks become parameters, to be filled in when you execute the
  statement

```php
$command = "INSERT INTO grades (firstname, lastname) VALUES (?, ?)";
$stmt = $dbh->prepare($command);
```

- Note: The word _parameter_ has a lot of different meanings in web app
  development
- Function and method parameters are used to receive arguments in a PHP program
- HTTP Request parameters are used to send data to a server-side script
- SQL Prepared Statement Parameters are question marks in an SQL command that
  are filled in later with arguments

### 3. Execute the statement

- You execute the statement by calling its execute method, passing an array of
  arguments
- These arguments will fill in the question mark parameters in the order that
  they appear
- The execute method returns true on success or false on failure

```php
$params = ["Drizzt", "Do'Urden"];
$success = $stmt->execute($params);
```

### 4. Check whether it worked

```php
if ($success) {
    echo "<p>Win!</p>";
    echo "<p>{$stmt->rowCount()} rows were affected.</p>";
} else {
    echo "<p>Fail...</p>";
}
```

- The `$stmt->execute()` method will return `true` if the query was ok, even if
  no rows were affected
- e.g. `DELETE FROM grades WHERE 0` will `succeed` even though it doesn’t do
  anything
- Use the `$stmt->rowCount()` method to check how many rows in the table were
  actually changed

## Getting Data from a Form

- When you are using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, you will often be getting data
  from a form
- Always use POST for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
- If you use GET, a user will be able to bookmark and repeat the operation
  repeatedly
- Make sure you sanitize and validate your parameters
- Then it is safe to use them to execute the query

## Example

```php
$fn = filter_input(
    INPUT_POST,
    "first",
    FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING
);

$exam = filter_input(
    INPUT_POST,
    "exam",
    FILTER_VALIDATE_INT
);

if ($fn !== null && $exam !== null && $exam !== false) {
    $command = "UPDATE grades SET final_exam=? WHERE firstname=?";
    $stmt = $dbh->prepare($command);
    $params = [$exam, $firstname];
    $success = $stmt->execute($params);
}
```

- The use of `filter_input` to retrieve parameters and `?` in the SQL command
  string is really important!
- It’s all about avoiding code injection attacks from malicious users

## Associative Arrays

- The SQL SELECT command is a little different from UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE
  because if it succeeds, the PHP program will receive a result set consisting
  of rows and columns of data from the database
- Processing that result set involves a new kind of data structure called an
  associative array

## What is an Associative Array?

- The PHP array type supports indexes of type int, but it also supports indexes
  of type string, allowing it to be used as an associative array
- Associative arrays are also known as dictionaries (type dict) in Python and as
  HashMaps in Java
- They associate (or map) keys to values

```php
$user              = [];
$user["studentid"] = "928374532";
$user["age"]       = 22;
$user["access"]    = true;
```

- This stores the string value `"928374532"` under the key `"id"`, the int value
  `22` under the key `"age"`, and the bool value true under the key `"access"`
- Note that the keys are all strings but the values stored can be of any type
- You could also have created the above array in one shot like this:

```php
$user = [
    "studentid" => "6534654754",
    "age"       => 18,
    "access"    => false
];
```

- You can access the values using the same keys

```php
if ($user["access"]) {
    echo "<h2>You have access!</h2>";
} else {
    echo "<h2>You do not have access.</h2>";
}
```

## Echoing Associative Array Contents

- If you want to echo an item from an associative array into the HTTP Response,
  you can embed it into a string using braces, like this:

```php
echo "<p>Your Userid: {$user["studentid"]}</p>";
```

- You can also do it without the braces or the double quotes on the key, like
  this:

```php
echo "<p>Your Userid: $user[studentid]</p>";
```

- The second option is nicer to look at, but it’s important to remember the
  braces option as well, because you will need it if you are embedding a PHP
  expression into an array index
- Here’s an example where you have no choice but to use braces:

```php
echo "<p>Your Userid: {$user[$a . $b]}</p>";
```

## Looping Through an Associative Array

- You can use the PHP foreach loop to cycle through all the keys and values in
  your array
- e.g. to print out each key-value pair from `$user` in its own table row, you
  could do this:

```php
foreach ($user as $key => $value) {
    echo "<tr><td>$key</td><td>$value</td></tr>";
}
```

- The above loop goes through the `$user` array, takes each key-value pair and
  puts it into the variables $key and $value respectively
- You can use any variable names for key and value

## Debugging Associative Arrays

- If you try to access a key in an associative array that is not defined, you
  will get an error on the PHP web page, something like this:

```
Notice: Undefined index: studentid in
C:\xampp\htdocs\arrays.php on line 24
```

- If you are running into errors like this, you can use the `var_dump` function
  inside a `<pre>` element for a nicely formatted look at everything contained
  in an associative array

```php
<pre>
    <?php var_dump($user); ?>
</pre>
```

## SELECT Queries

- To SELECT and display data from the database on a web page using PHP, there
  are five basic steps

1. Connect to the DB
2. Prepare a SELECT statement
3. Execute the statement
4. Check whether it worked
5. Retrieve the results

## Steps 1 through 4: Connect, Prepare, Execute, Check

- The steps are the same when executing SELECT queries
- Here’s what preparing and executing a SELECT query could look like

```php
$command = "SELECT firstname, lastname FROM grades WHERE final_exam>? ORDER BY Title"
$stmt = $dbh->prepare($command);
$params = [50];
$success = $stmt->execute($params);
if ($success) {
    /* it worked! */
}
```

## Step 5: Retrieve the Results

- The `$stmt->execute()` method fetches an array known as a result set
- The result set will contain only the columns you asked for in the SELECT
  clause and only the rows that matched the WHERE clause
- To retrieve the first row from the result set and store it in an array named
  $row, use this statement:

```php
$row = $stmt->fetch();
```

- Then use the same statement again to get the second row, and again for the
  third and so on
- When there are no more rows, `$stmt->fetch()` will return null.
- Since null casts to false while every non-empty array casts to true, we can
  use a loop like this:

```php
while($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
    // process the next $row here
}
```

- If you’re expecting only one row (e.g. you searched for a value on the primary
  key field or if you used LIMIT 1 in the SELECT statement) you can use an if
  statement, like this:

```php
if($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
    // process the $row here
} else {
    // the result set was empty
}
```

- The above if and while statements are standard in the world of PHP database
  access
- But they might look strange if you have never seen anything like this before
- Here’s some explanation...

```php
$row = $stmt->fetch()
```

- The above is an assignment statement
- Assignment statements evaluate to the value that was assigned, as if they were
  arithmetic expressions
- e.g. `$x = 5` evaluates to 5
- Try the following:

```php
echo $x = 5;
echo $x;
```

- You should see the string `"55"` appear in your output.
- The first statement assigned 5 to `$x` and then printed the return value (i.e.
  `"5"`)
- The second printed the value of `$x` again
- In PHP, any value can be interpreted as Boolean, so you can embed any
  assignment statement where you would normally put a Boolean expression
- The while statement shown above will fetch the next row, assign it to the
  variable `$row`, and then execute the loop
- When there are no more rows, `$stmt->fetch()` returns null, which is
  interpreted as false and the loop stops

## Display the Results

- The data from each row will be stored in an associative array
- The keys of the array match the column names from the database table
- The code below will echo a list of poll titles from the database to the HTML
  output of the PHP script

```php
while($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
    echo "<p>$row[firstname]</p>";
}
```

## Debugging Tips

- If you are getting undefined index errors, use `var_dump` to display the exact
  contents of each `$row`
- If you use `var_dump`, you will notice that every piece of data appears twice
  in `$row` – once using the column name as a key, and once using an integer
  key.

```
array(4) {
    ["firstname"] => string(4) "Anne"
    [0] => string(4) "Anne"
    ["lastname"] => string(8) "St-Amand"
    [1] => string(8) "St-Amand"
}
```

- One possible source of errors is case sensitivity
- SQL is not case sensitive by default, but PHP is
- If the column name in the database is AAA and you retrieve it with `SELECT *`,
  you’re looking for `$row["AAA"]`
- But if you retrieve it with `SELECT aaa ...`, the query will succeed (because
  SQL ignores case) but now you’re looking for `$row["aaa"]` (because PHP does
  not ignore case)
- For this reason, it’s probably a good idea to always use lowercase names in
  the database

## Store the Results for Later

- Make sure you have read the Functions and Objects section from Module 1 before
  reading this
- When you’re retrieving a lot of data from the database, it’s a good idea to
  create a class that you can use to create an object for each row of data
- This class could also have methods (or could be paired with global view
  functions) that return nicely formatted HTML strings
- In your code, create an array of objects by starting with an empty array and
  using array_push:

```php
$userlist = [];
while ($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
    $user = new User($row["firstname"], $row["lastname"]);
    array_push($userlist, $user);
}
```

- Then later, call the display method to put each object on the page:

```php
foreach ($userlist as $user) {
    echo $user->toListItem();
}
```

## Writing Code from Data

- In the previous section, you saw how to use SELECT queries to customize the
  contents of a page
- But there are lots of cases in which you might want to use data from a SELECT
  query to customize the HTML, CSS, and maybe even JavaScript code in your HTTP
  Response
- For example, you might want to show a list of student names, but allow the
  user to click each name to go to a view page where you can view the entire
  student record
- Then you might want to be able to click a button on the view page to delete or
  update that student record
- One way to do this is to use the results of your SELECT query to customize an
  HTML element’s attributes

## Writing Link Parameters

- The example.php file in the select_to_code folder of the sample code gets
  student names and ids from the database:

```php
$command = "SELECT firstname, lastname, student_id FROM grades ORDER BY lastname";
```

- Then when it outputs the data, it uses `$row[student_id]` to write a GET
  parameter directly into the href attribute of an `<a>` element
- The code for this is below

```php
while ($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
    echo "<a href='getuser.php?id=$row[student_id]'>";
    echo "<li>$row[firstname] $row[lastname]</li>";
    echo "</a>"; # Writing a get parameter into the link.
}
```

- The links look something like this when they arrive at the browser:

```html
<a href='getuser.php?id=6'>
    <li>Drizzt Do'Urden</li>
</a>
```

- The getuser.php file retrieves the parameter and uses it to launch a select
  query to get the rest of the user information

## Writing Hidden Input Elements

- The getuser.php file gets the student id from a get parameter
- It uses a SELECT query to get the rest of the user information to display it,
  and then it creates a special delete form using the student id

```php
<form action="deleteuser.php" method="post">
    // Writing a value attribute
    <input type="hidden" name="id" value="<?= $row['student_id'] ?>">
    <input type="submit" value="Yes, Please!">
</form>
```

## Close everything properly

- An `<input>` element with `type="hidden"` will send a parameter when the form
  is submitted, but it does not appear on the page or allow the user to change
  its value attribute
- So you can fix its value to be whatever you want
- This is handy passing values along from page to page
- It’s actually a primitive form of session management because it lets you keep
  track of the user from one page to the next
- When the user presses the submit button in this form, a post request will be
  launched to `deleteuser.php` with the value set to the id of the student that
  is being displayed
- Then `deleteuser.php` can use an SQL DELETE query to remove the student record
  from the table
