# Wordpress

## Content management systems

- Content management systems are applications used to manage digital content
  (i.e. web pages)
  - Multiple users can access a "backend" that allows them to create articles
    and other content viewable by the public on the "frontend"
  - Potentially multiple different types of users, publishers, editors,
    administrators, etc.
- Content Management Systems in one form or another power roughly 50% of the web
  - Drupal, WordPress & Joomla are 3 biggest - all use PHP!

## WordPress

- WordPress is the most popular CMS
- Powers roughly 1/3rd of the web, tens of millions of sites
- Based on PHP & MySQL, first released in 2003
- Most associated with blogging, but can support all kinds of web content (e.g.
  forums, web stores, etc)
- Supported by massive community online and offline
- WordPress features a plugin architecture and template engine
  - Both involve "one click installs" that allow us to greatly customize website
    functionality
- Templates are called "themes" in WordPress
  - Allow sites to change appearance entirely
  - Can be customized by users, created and sold for profit
- Plugins extend the functionality of WordPress
  - e.g. plugins for calendars, forums, e-commerce, etc
  - Can also be customized, created and sold for profit

## XAMPP

- XAMPP allows us to run an Apache web server with PHP and MySQL locally
  - A similar environment to CSUnix, but on our machine
  - We'll use XAMPP for WordPress because CSUnix has configuration issues and
    slow performance
  - You can [Install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) free
- After installing XAMPP, PHP and other files placed under the htdocs folder
  will be accessible in the browser at the URL localhost

## MAMP

- MAMP is an equivalent to XAMPP for Mac
  - You can also get XAMPP for Mac, but the configuration doesn't work well with
    WordPress
  - If you're on a Mac, use MAMP for WordPress
  - You can [Install MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en)
- MAMP also has an htdocs folder that is mapped to the server running at
  localhost
  - Change the Apache port to 80

## WordPress installation

- [Download](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/download/#download-install) it from
  WordPress.org
- Follow the
  [guide to install](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress)
  WordPress
- Create a database with `phpMyAdmin` called `wordpress` for your wordpress
  database!
- With XAMPP the MySQL database username is `root` and the password is `""`
- With MAMP the MySQL database username is `root` and the password is `root`

## WordPress Themes

- WordPress themes define much of the style, layout and structure for a
  WordPress website
- E.g. themes define where a menu appears on the page, but not which items are
  in the menu
- WordPress
  [theme repository](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/themes/browse/featured)
- There are other repositories and paid websites hosting premium themes
- Installing WordPress Themes can usually be done automatically from the backend
- WordPress themes can also be installed by unzipping them into
  /wp-content/themes folder
- WordPress themes then need to be activated to make them the currently used
  theme

## WordPress Theme Development

- [Official documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development)
- Anyone can build and release entirely new WordPress themes built from scratch
  - Whether this is "worth it" or not is a business question
- But what's a lot more common is to build child themes themes that inherit all
  of the styling of a parent theme, and then make modifications
  - Allows us to customize pre-existing themes however we like

## WordPress theme files

- WordPress themes may contain a lot of different files that work together,
  let's go through them
- styles.css
  - Defines the CSS styles for the theme
  - May contain all the styles, it's possible to split styles over multiple
    files
  - Also contains theme details in comments at the top of the page
  - These theme details must be present for the theme to work
  - No two themes may have the same details
- screenshot.webp
  - This will represent the theme in the WordPress backend theme selection page
- js, img, fonts, etc folders
  - These folders contain images, Javascript, fonts and other code used by the
    theme to render the page
- functions.php
  - Basically acts like a plugin... it's run by WordPress during initialization
  - Can define helper functions used in your theme files
  - Loads theme style sheets and scripts
  - Enables theme features such as sidebars, navigation menus, etc.
  - Set up an option menu to allow admin users the ability to change aspects of
    the theme
- Template files
  - [Template files](https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates) define
    different portions of the page
  - At a minimum, an index.php file must be present
  - Template files like single.php define the page for a single post, page.php
    for a page, etc.
  - Other template files like header.php, footer.php, sidebar.php typically
    exist for defining those portions of the page
  - index.php will include these different parts of the page with code like
    `<?php get_header() ?>` and/or load in different templates with
    `get_template_part()`

## WordPress theme modifications

- Often it's cost and time prohibitive to create themes from scratch, and we can
  find a theme that is "very close" to what we need anyways
- We can technically modify the theme files directly to alter the behaviour and
  style of the theme
  - Problem: themes themselves regularly update, and when the theme updates,
    your modifications will be overwritten!
- Solution: child themes
  - Allow us to make tweaks to existing themes that won't be overwritten when
    the parent theme is updated

## WordPress child themes

- Child themes can be created by creating a directory called `parentname-child`
  under the `/wp-content/themes` folder
  - Where `parentname` is the name of the parent theme
- You can then define a style.css file that provides additional styles and/or
  re-defines existing files
  - Your style.css file will need to have a unique Theme Name, and it will need
    to reference the parent theme with Template (i.e. Template: `twentyfifteen`)
- You also must provide a functions.php file that loads in the parent themes
  style sheets
- See
  [full details](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes)
  on creating child themes

# PHP

## Server-Side Scripting and PHP

- A **Web App** is a collection of computer programs that run independently and
  communicate with each other over the web to present the appearance of a single
  program.
- Web Apps are accessed through a browser (client) which retrieves files from a
  remote server.
- Some of the programs involved in the app run on the client, and others run on
  the server.
- **Front-End** web developers work on the client side of a web app.
- **Back-End** web developers work on the server side.
- **Full-Stack** web developers work on both the client and server side using
  the _Full Stack_ of technologies that make up a web app.
- Server-side scripts are computer programs that run on the web server.
- You can write server-side scripts using JavaScript, Java, C#, or any other
  language.
- But the most common
  [language for server-side](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language)
  development is PHP.
- Server-side scripts are run by the web server, when it receives an HTTP
  Request.
- The job of the script is to help the server create the HTTP Response to send
  back to the user by filling in the content and the other details.
- In Chrome, if you press Ctrl-Shift-i, or F12, you can enter the Developer
  Tools.
- Go to the **Network** tab and load your favorite web site.
- Here, you can view and explore all of the **HTTP Requests** and **HTTP
  Responses** involved in loading that site.

## Hello, World!

- Let’s get started with the classic “Hello, World!” program.
- You cannot run a PHP program without a web server.
- You can use **XAMPP** to turn your computer into a web server.
- Install it on your home machine (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- Once you have installed XAMPP:
  - Run XAMPP
  - Press the “Start” button for Apache(this is the web server component)
  - Use Chrome to navigate to http://localhost (home installation)
- The address http://localhost (or :1080) maps to your htdocs folder.
- On Windows, this folder can be found at C:/xampp/htdocs.
- On Linux or Mac, you will find it somewhere inside the XAMPP installation
  folder.
- Now follow these steps:
  - Create a new folder callled `helloworld` inside `htdocs`.
  - The name should be a single lowercase word.
  - Create `template.php` inside `helloworld` folder.
  - Use Chrome to navigate to http://localhost/helloworld.
  - Click `template.php` to run it.
  - Open `template.php` using **VS Code** and add this:
  ```php
  <?php echo"<p>Hello, World!</p>"; ?>
  ```
  - Reload template.phpto see the difference.
- Use view page source in Chrome or use the Network tab in Developer Tools to
  view the HTTP Response.
- This is the raw output of your program.
- The PHP interpreter executed the code inside the `<?php ?>` tag and placed the
  output of the code in that position.
- Always keep in mind that your PHP programs should return syntactically-correct
  HTML5 code.
- Remember to put all content inside a non-deprecated HTML element, and close
  all your tags.
- Now add more `<?php ?>` tags with `echo` statements.
- Make a CSS file and load it with a `<link>` tag;
- Change the file name to `index.php` so it loads from
  http://localhost/helloworld.

## The PHP Language

### Things You Know from Java

- PHP uses C-style syntax, including if, switch, while, for, do, operators,
  commenting, etc.

### Things You Know from Python

- PHP is an interpreted language.
- It supports imperative programming (i.e. no classes or main method necessary).
- It’s dynamically-typed (no need to declare variable or function types).
- You can use `#` for commenting instead of `//`, and you can use `and` and `or`
  instead of `&&` and `||`.
- PHP supports both styles.

### PHP Types

- PHP has four primitive data types: int, float, bool, and null.
  - The null data type is a special data type with only one value: `NULL`.
- PHP also has three non-primitive data types: string, array, and object.

### PHP Variables

- Variable names must start with a `$` character.
- Variable names are case sensitive, even though other parts of the language are
  not.

### PHP Strings

- If you use double quoted strings, you can embed variable names.
- If you use single quoted strings, variable names will not get interpreted.

```php
<?php
    $luckynum = rand(1, 10);
    echo "<p>Your lucky number is $luckynum</p>"
?>
```

- If you want to concatenate, you must use the `.`(dot) operator, not `+`.

```php
echo "<p>Your lucky number is " . $luckynum . "</p>";
```

### The PHP Expression Tag

- If you just want to show the result of an expression, sometimes it makes for
  more maintainable code to use the `<?= ?>` expression tag.

```php
<p><?= $luckynum * 2 ?></p>
```

### Weak Typing

- PHP is a weakly typed language.
- This is not the same as being dynamically typed.
- For example, Python is dynamically typed but it is not weakly typed.
- Java is neither dynamically typednor weakly typed.
- It’s statically typed (opposite of dynamically typed) and strongly typed
  (opposite of weakly typed).
- In a weakly typed language, there are never any syntax or run-time errors for
  mixing types in an expression or passing the wrong type to a function.
- You get logic errors instead, which are much harder to debug.
- You gain flexibility and convenience, but at a price.
- This is all legal in PHP:

```php
$a = false + 12;

if (null>= 0) {
    echo "<p>null is 0</p>";
}

if ("hello") {
    echo "<p>'PHP' is true</p>";
}
```

- In the above examples, PHP converts `false` and `null` to `integers` and
  `"hello"` to a `Boolean` value.
- Weak typing is really just a very aggressive form of automatic type casting.
- Because it is weakly-typed, PHP contains two new Boolean operators for strict
  equality (`===`) and strict inequality (`!==`).
- These operators compare both the type and the value before returning trueor
  false.

## Three Gotchas

### String Concatenation

- If you’re used to Java and Python, at some point you’ll probably do something
  like this:

```php
$name = "John";
echo"<p>Hello "+ $name+ "!</p>";
```

- The above code will cause the string `"0"` to be placed into the output of
  your program. Why?

### Single-Quoted Strings

- Always use double-quoted strings! **Single-quoted strings are literal
  strings**.
- Double-quoted strings are richly interpreted.
- Try the following code snippet to see the difference:

```php
$age = 5;
echo "<p>You entered $age for your age\n.</p>";
echo '<p>You entered $age for your age\n.</p>';
```

### Assignment vs. Comparison

- Even seasoned programmers make the following mistake from time to time:

```php
$guess = 5;

if ($guess = 6) {
    echo "<p>You guessed correctly!</p>";
} else {
    echo "<p>Sorry, try again.</p>";
}
```

- In Java and Python, this would be a syntax error.
- But PHP prints the success message.
- In most C-like languages, assignment (`=`) is anoperator just like `+`, `*`,
  etc.
- This means that assignment statements return a value and can be embedded
  within other statements.
- Here are examples from PHP and Java:

```php
echo "<p>The answer is " . ($x = 5) . "!<p>";
```

```java
System.out.println("The answer is " + (x = 5) + "!");
```

- In both cases, the assignment expression evaluates to `5` and places `"5"`
  into the output.
- After the statements have executed, the variable `$x` (or `x` in the case of
  Java) contains the value 5.
- In the original if statement above, `$guess` gets assigned 6, and the value 6
  gets placed in the if statement.
- So it becomes equivalent to:

```php
if (6) {
    // ...
}
```

- In Java, that’s a type error because 6 is not a boolean value.
- But in PHP, 6 gets converted to the bool value TRUE.
- PHP converts most values to TRUE. (0, "", [], and NULL convert to FALSE.)

## Using Formsto Send Parameters

- So far, our PHP programs have not been able to get any input from the user.
- In a typical server-side app, user input is collected with an HTML formand
  then gets sent as parametersalong with the HTTP Request.
- In this section, we’ll talk about how to construct an HTML form.

### Two Basic Form Elements

- The `<form>` element contains a form.
- The `<input>` element can be used to create many types of input controls
  within a form.
- The form specified below contains a text fieldand a submit button.

```html
<form>
    <input type = "text" />
    <input type = "submit" />
</form>
```

- Here are some other values you can put in the type attribute of an `<input>`
  element:
  - **password** (for getting masked text strings)
  - **number** and **range** (for getting integersand floats)
  - **url** and **email** (for getting Internet address strings)
  - **date** and **time** (for getting time and date information)
  - **color** (for selection colors)
  - **button** (for non-submitting button elements)
- Here are some other attributes you can use to configure an input element.
- For text, url and email:
  - placholder="...", size="...", maxlength="..."
- For numbers, dates, and times:
  - max="...", min="...", step="..."
- For all input types:
  - orequired, autofocus, title="...", value="..."

## A CSS Selector for Forms

- You can use CSS to style `<input>` and `<form>` elements just like any other
  HTML element (although sometimes it is hard to make the form elements look
  better than their default styles).
- To style each input type separately in CSS rules, you can use the attribute
  selector (`[attribute=value]`).
- Here’s an example:

```css
input[type=text] {
    background-color: lightblue;
    height: 30px;
    font-size: 24px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

### Sending Form Data to a Server

- In a client-server web app, the form data usually must besent to the server.
- You specify where the data will go by putting an action attribute in the
  `<form>` tag.
- You send the data from the form by giving every element a name attribute.
- You should control the user as much as possible by using attributes like
  required, min, max, etc.

```html
<form action="nextpage.php">
    <input type="number" name="streetnumber" required min="1">
    <input type="text" name="streetname" required>
    <input type="submit">
</form>
```

- In the code above, when the user presses the submit button, `nextpage.php`
  will load, and will be sent the data from the text and number fields.
- When the form is submitted, you will be able to see the parameters in the URL.
- They will look like something like this:

http://localhost/myfolder/nextpage.php?streetnumber=88&streetname=Elm

- ? (question-mark) separates the addressfrom the parameters.
- streetnumber and streetname are parameter names.
- 88 and Elm are parameter values.
- & (empersand) separates one parameter from the next.
- You can also see the parameters in the Network tab of the Chrome Developer
  Tools.

## GET vs. POST

- In your `<form>` tag, you should also add a `method` attribute.
- You can use `method="get"` or `method="post"`.

```html
<form action="nextPage.php" method="post">
    <input type="number" name="streetnumber"required min="1">
    <input type="text" name="streetname"required>
    <input type="submit">
</form>
```

- If you use post, the parameters will be sent in the body of the HTTP Request,
  rather than in the header as part of the URL.
- You will still be able to view them in the Network tab of Chrome Developer
  Tools.
- Use `post` for sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.
- Using post does not encrypt the data or make its transmission secure.
- But it does stop someone from reading it over the user’s shoulder, and it
  stops the user from accidentally bookmarking it or sharing it with somebody as
  part of the URL.

## Using PHP to Receive Parameters

- There are several ways to retrieve parameters from an HTTP Request.
- We’re going to use the PHP `filter_input` functions.

### Receiving Integers

- The URL below contains two get parameters named streetnumber and streetname.
- http://localhost/myfolder/nextpage.php?streetnumber=88&streetname=Elm
- To receive the streetnumbe rparameter, we would include the following code in
  the nextpage.php program:

```php
$streetnum = filter_input(
    INPUT_GET,
    "streetnumber",
    FILTER_VALIDATE_INT
);
```

- The `filter_input` function looks for a get parameter named `streetnumber`.
- It will return:
  - **null** if the parameter is not found (i.e. the client didn’t send it)
  - **false** if the parameter was found but is not an integer (e.g.
    `streetnumber=dunno`)
  - **int** if the parameter is found and is correctly formatted
- If you want to check that you got a properly formatted parameter, you’ll need
  ifstatements to make sure `$streetnum` isn’t `null` or `false`.
- You must use strict equality or inequality (`===` or `!==`) for this, because
  if `$streetnum` is `0`, `$streetnum == null` and `$streetnum == false` are
  both `true`.
- **INPUT_GET** is a global constant.
- Change it to **INPUT_POST** if you want to receive POST parameters.
- **FILTER_VALIDATE_INT** is also a global constant.
- It signals that `filter_input` should attempt to treat the parameter as an
  int.

### Receiving Strings

- To receive the streetname parameter from the URL above, we would include the
  following code in the `nextpage.php` program:

```php
$streetname = filter_input(
    INPUT_GET,
    "streetname",
    FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS
);
```

- The only thing different here is that we are using
  **FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS**.
- It’s a sanitize filter instead of a validate filter.
- It makes sure that special characters get replaced with HTML entities so that
  they will display correctly and not get interpreted as HTML code.
- For example the character `<` gets replaced with the html entity `&#60;`.
- If we were to `echo '<'` directly into theHTTP Response, the browser would
  treat it as the start of an HTML tag.
- In the case of **FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS**, the `filter_input` function
  will return:
  - null if the parameter is not found (i.e. the client didn’t send it)
  - string with special characters _sanitized_ for output if the parameter is
    found
- You have to use `$streetname === null` or `$streetname !== null` to make sure
  the parameter was received properly.

### Other Filters

- If you are receiving numbers or special strings, use a validate filter.
- Here are some options: **FILTER_VALIDATE_INT** **FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT**
  **FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL** **FILTER_VALIDATE_URL**
- These validate filters will return `null` if the parameter is not found,
  `false` if it’s not formatted correctly, or a value of the appropriate type
  otherwise.
- If you’re receiving normal string data, you should use a sanitize filter:
  **FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS** **FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING**
- These filters will return `null` if the parameter is not found, or a sanitized
  string otherwise.
- The _**SPECIAL_CHARS** filter will replace special characters with
  browser-safe codes.
- The _**STRING** filter will strip HTML tags out of the input completely.

## Arrays

- PHP arrays are a bit like Python lists.
- They can contain elements of different types, and they have no fixed length.
- PHP also supports array literals using square brackets.

```php
$a = ["red", 23, 55.7];
```

- You can access and iterate through array elements just like you would in Java.

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < count($a); $i++) {
    echo$a[$i];
}
```

- You can also use the special `foreach` loop, which is similar to Java’s
  enhanced for loop:

```php
foreach($a as $element) {
    echo$element;
}
```

- You can embed array references into double-quoted strings:

```php
echo "Element 0 is $a[0].";
```

- Arrays are not objects in PHP, so there are no array methods.
- All helper functions for arrays are global functions.
- Two that are of particular use are:

```php
count($a); # returns the length of $a
array_push($a, $item); # adds $item to the end of the array $a
```

- For a list of array functions, see
  https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_array.asp.

### An Aside on Strings

- Strings in PHP are just arrays of characters.
- You can access them as if they were arrays.
- But there is no char type in PHP, so if `$s` is a string, `$s[4]` returns a
  string containing the 5th character of `$s`.
- Note that we use the `strlen` function for the length of a string.

```php
$s = "server-side scripting is fun!";
for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($s); $i++) {
    if ($s[$i] === "s") {
        $s[$i] = "S";
    }
}
```

## Modularization

- Modular scripts that use functions, classes, and objects.

### Functions

- Functions are declared with the `function` keyword. Functions in PHP can be
  global–they do not need to be part of a class. Here’s a simple example of a
  global function.

```php
function spam($a, $b, $c) {
    return $a + $b + $c;
}
```

- You could call it like this:

```php
<p><?= spam(1, 2, 3) ?></p>
```

- You do not need to specify return type or parameter type.
- If the function doesn’t execute a `return` statement, it will return the value
  `null` by default.
- There is no function overloading in PHP, but you can achieve something similar
  by using default argument values.

```php
function spam($a, $b=0, $c=0) { # $b and $c have default values.
    return $a + $b + $c;
}

<p>
    <?= spam(1) ?> # Uses both default values
    <?= spam(1, 2) ?> # Uses default valuefor $c
    <?= spam(1, 2, 3) ?>
</p>
```

- If you give a parameter a default argument value, all the parameters that
  follow must also have default values.

```php
function spam($a, $b=0, $c) { # Not allowed. $c must have a default as well.
    return $a + $b + $c;
}
```

### Objects

- Full support for object-oriented programming was added to PHP in version 5.
- Before that, PHP was a purely imperative language.
- Now you can program using a mix of the two styles.
- Here’s an example of a class declaration in PHP:

```php
class Person {
    // instance variables
    private $name;
    private $age;

    // constructor function must be named __construct
    public function __construct($name, $age= -1) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    public function get_name() {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function get_age() {
        return $this->age;
    }

    public function increase_age($increment) {
        $this->age += $increment;
    }
}
```

- And here’s how you create objects of type Person.
- This should all look familiar from Java.

```php
$p1 = newPerson("Harry");
$p2 = newPerson("Anne", 30);
```

- Here’s how you access a method.
- Note the use of the arrow operator (`->`) instead of the `.` (dot) operator.
- The dot operator is reserved for string concatenation in PHP.

```php
$p1->increase_age(11);
```

- If you want to include a method call inside a double-quoted string, use
  braces.

```php
echo "Your name is {$p1->get_name()}.";
```

## Php My Admin (phpmyadmin)

### Logging in to XAMPP phpmyadmin

- Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin (you might need 8080 port number)
- Login is automatic
- Your actual MySQL userid is root, and your password is the empty string

### Exporting Your Table

- Select the table you want to export by clicking it on the left hand side of
  phpmyadmin (select just the table, not the whole database)
- Go to the EXPORT tab
- Press GO to create a `.sql` file that can be IMPORTed into another DB

### Importing Your Table

- Select your database by clicking it on the left hand side of phpmyadmin
- Go to the IMPORT tab
- Click Choose File and select your `.sql` file
- Scroll to the bottom and press Go

### When Import Fails

- If you get an `Unknown Character Set` error
  - Open your `.sql` file
  - Look for `DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4` in the CREATE TABLE query in the `.sql`
    file and delete it (don’t delete the semicolon)

- If you get an `Unknown Character Set` error
  - Open your `.sql` file
  - Look for `DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4` in the CREATE TABLE query in the `.sql`
    file and delete it (don’t delete the semicolon)
